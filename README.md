# Baskify

Baskify was borne of a pandemic-era desire to support the struggling nonprofit community in the wake of a move away from in-person events. I noticed, particularly amongst non-profits in my local area, that a large source of funding came from conducting theme basket auctions, I wanted to try and invent a way for this to continue in the absense of in-person auctions.
Baskify facilitates online theme basket auctions specifically for organizations registered with the IRS's public list of 503(c)(3) organizations. The project was deprecated when it became clear that there were insurmountable legal hurtles surrounding an online pseudo-gambling website, especially one that caters specifically to non-profit organizations. The code remains as
a historical archive of my first attempt into ASP.NET MVC and C#.
